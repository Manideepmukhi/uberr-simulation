# 🚗 Uberr - Ride-Hailing Backend Simulation

This is a backend simulation of a ride-hailing platform (like Uber/Ola), built using **Django** with a clean and modular architecture.

It models the **full ride lifecycle**, **driver allocation**, and **fare computation** using background scripts and Django's ORM.

## 🧪 Features Implemented

### ✅ Ride Lifecycle

Each ride follows the full journey:

1. `create_ride` – Rider requests a ride  
2. `driver_assigned` – System assigns an available nearby driver  
3. `driver_at_location` – Driver reaches pickup point  
4. `start_ride` – Ride starts  
5. `end_ride` – Ride ends, fare is computed  

Timestamps are tracked for all key transitions.

---

### ✅ Driver Matching Rules

- Searches for nearby drivers within expanding radius (2km every 10s)
- Driver must be available
- Cannot be assigned to multiple rides at once
- Excludes:
  - Drivers who completed a ride with the same rider in last 30 minutes
  - Drivers who cancelled their last 2 rides

---

### ✅ Fare Computation Formula

Fare = Base Fare + (Distance × Rate per KM) + (Duration × Rate per Minute) + Waiting Charges

Rates are configurable via key-value pairs (`FareConfig` model):

| Config Key              | Example Value |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| `base_fare`             | ₹50.0         |
| `per_km`                | ₹10.0         |
| `per_minute`           | ₹2.0          |
| `waiting_charge_per_min` | ₹1.0        |
